            This post explains why you should most definitely get an extended
            rear-facing car seat.

              <li>
                what extended rear-facing (ERF for short) car seats are and why
                they are safer than forward facing seats{' '}
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite some information online about how much safer ERF seats
                are, in reality there is no official figure confirming by how
                much safer they are. We would need a lot more data to quantify
                this, however, every single expert agrees that ERF seats are
                safer than forward facing seats.

          <h4>BASICS</h4>

          <p>
            The World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a document in 2009 on
            child safety and defined the purpose of child car seats as follows:
          </p>

          <p>
            “The bone-forming process is not complete until the age of 6 or 7
            years, and throughout childhood a child’s skull remains less strong
            than that of an adult. A restraint system needs to limit forward
            head movement in a frontal impact and provide protection from
            intrusion in a side impact.{' '}
            <strong>
              A child restraint should therefore distribute the crash forces
              over as wide an area as possible
            </strong>
            .”
          </p>

          <p>
            This is exactly what extended rear-facing car seats are designed to
            do and why they are better at minimising injuries than forward
            facing seats: they distribute crash forces over a wider area than
            forward facing seats.

          <p>
            Over the years car seat design has evolved to do exactly what the
            WHO meant: to better protect children’s vulnerable heads and necks
            in the event of an accident.
          </p>

          <p>
            And children’s heavy heads are exactly the reason why forward facing
            seats are not as safe as ERF car seats. Proportionately to body
            weight, children’s heads are heavier than adult heads.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means that in the event of a front crash, their heavy heads
            have less support and their neck muscles can snap.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following video by Trygg Trafikk, a Norwegian organisation
            promoting road safety, illustrates the point clearly:

            Most children get an infant car seat which lasts up to 13kgs or when
            the child is about 12 months old. Extended rear-facing car seats
            allow children to travel backwards for longer than the initial 12
            months of life. ERF seats provide protection in back and side
            crashes just as forward-facing seats do. In{' '}

            , the car seat manufacturer Axkid describes how a girl seated in a
            rear-facing car seat came out of an accident unharmed. What’s
            interesting is that the accident was not a front crash but an impact
            from the back.
          </p>

          <p>
            But ERF seats outperform forward facing seats in front crashes. What
            do front impact accidents look like? Here’s an example of a front
            impact crash in a test setting:

          <p>
            Extended rear-facing car seats are absolutely critical in minimising
            injuries in children by as much as possible.
          </p>

          <h4>HOW MUCH?</h4>

          <p>
            How much safer can ERF seats be as compared to forward facing seats?
            Well, this is where things become a little bit more tricky. As
            researchers tried to quantify how much safer ERF car seats are, they
            all got different results depending on their research designs.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            A comparison of data on injuries in children in car accidents in
            Germany and Sweden shows just how important rear-facing car seats
            are in minimising injuries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, a widely quoted study from 2007 which formed the basis of
            official recommendations to keep children rear-facing for longer was
            retracted in 2018. The original study in 2007 claimed that ERF seats
            are 5 times safer than forward facing seats. The researchers used
            data from American accidents and got statistically significant
            results which recently were shown not to be replicable. In other
            words, the analysis of data in the original study was conducted
            incorrectly which in turn made the results look a lot more
            significant than they actually were.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Does this mean that rear-facing seats are actually not any safer
            than forward facing seats? Absolutely not! It simply means that
            there is not enough data to confirm that ERF seats are safer. An
            updated study in 2018 showed that we would need 12,000 children in
            accidents to provide statistical confidence to confirm such
            assumption. With the safety of car seats significantly improving, 28
            years of US data yielded just over 1,100 accidents with children
            younger than 2 years old (the age analysed by the researchers). So
            I’m going to focus on absolute terms rather than statistical
            confidence. In a snapshot, the updated study is not statistically
            significant but shows that at the age of 1, when a lot of children
            are switched from an infant car seat to a toddler seat, only 5
            children were injured in rear-facing seats and 29 were injured in a
            forward facing seat (data for years 1993 to 2015). In weighted terms
            (for the statistically-minded readers), ERF seats were also safer
            than forward facing seats. <br />
            The authors concluded that “In the absence of a sufficient US field
            injury data set, biomechanical studies and the field experience in
            Sweden, where most children in this age range and beyond are
            rear-facing, remain the key justifications for the recommendation to
            keep children rear-facing as long as possible, up to the height or
            weight limit of the CRS.”
            <br />
            <br />
            So please don’t be alarmed if you read headlines which suggest that
            rear-facing isn’t as good as we thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Europe and America, numerous organisations recommend rear-facing
            seats for as long as possible (click here for Car Seat Jungle’s list
            of just a few of these organisations) and with the new i-Size
            regulations there’s a move towards making rear-facing seats a
            requirement. Specifically, when using an i-Size seat the child must
            stay rear-facing until approx. 15 months but can stay rear-facing
            for longer than this. For a full i-Size guide please follow this
            link. Also, you can view the official UK Government recommendations
            on car seats{' '}
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/child-car-seats-the-rules">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The consensus is that ERF seats are safer but there is no exact
            answer as to by how much. Does it matter? No, because every study
            and all research points in the same direction: ERF car seats are
            safer, full stop.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            For the unconvinced, here are a few more resources which show just
            how important keeping kids rear-facing for as long as possible is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Car seat manufacturer Joie tested their rear-facing vs. forward
            facing car seats and found that rear-facing seats outperformed
            forward seats by a mile. Their test results showed:
            <ol>
              <li>70% less risk of head injury</li>
              <li>73% less tension on the neck</li>
              <li>34% less neck rotational force</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also find similar figures on other car seat manufacturer
            website. For example, Axkid claim that “the safety and protection
            effect is 90-95% in a rear-facing car seat, compared to 60-70% in a
            forward-facing car seat” (
            <a href="https://www.axkid.com/reason-child-travel-rear-facing-six-years-old/">
              source
            </a>
            ). Many of these don’t provide any reference as to where the % come
            from. What studies have been conducted to confirm this? I did some
            research and found that the figures are based on two Scandinavian
            studies:{' '}
            <a href="https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/973299">Volvo data</a>{' '}
            from 1997 and{' '}

              Tingvall
            </a>{' '}
            (1987). Both looked at data of car accidents where children were
            involved and concluded that ERF car seats minimise the risk of
            injury in children involved in car accidents. If you think these
            studies are outdated (both from over 30 years ago) be assured that
            newer research confirms the trends found in these original pieces of
            research, as shown above.

          <h4>WHICH CAR SEATS</h4>
          <p>
            Having reviewed the advantages of ERF car seats, let’s now turn to
            the practicalities of buying an ERF car seat: what seats are
            available, how much do they cost and where to buy them.

            There are over 40 ERF seats available on the UK market. A lot of
            information online will say that ERF seats are suitable for children
            up to approx. 4 years of age but this isn’t correct. There are three
            extended rear-facing types of car seats based on the weight of the
            child (not age) and an overwhelming 65% of these are for children
            weighing 0 - 18 kgs. The graph below highlights the different
            groups. Remember that you should know the weight or height of your
            child when buying and using a car seat. Some kids at 4 years old
            will be lighter and others will be heavier than the car seat limit

            In practical terms, an extended rear-facing car seat costs on
            average £285 in the UK. This is 14% more expensive than forward
            facing seats in the same weight categories as extended rear-facing
            car seats which on average cost £250, so an absolute difference of
            £35.
          </p>
          <p>
            For clarity, seats which are not extended rear-facing and which can
            carry children from birth to 18 kgs are rear-facing up to 13 kgs and
            then the child needs to be switched to a forward facing position.
            For example, the Maxi-Cosi Milofix is{' '}
            <a href="https://www.maxi-cosi.co.uk/gb-en/car-seats/milofix.aspx">
              listed
            </a>{' '}
            as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Rearward-facing from 0-13kg (from birth to approx. 15/18m)
              </li>
              <li>Forward-facing from 9-18kg (from approx. 9m to 4y)</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            ERF seats are also heavier. Weighing on average 12.2 kgs they are
            approx. 2 kgs heavier than non-ERF car seats in the same weight
            groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 8 seats which have everything, that is advanced side
            impact protection, i-size compliance, ISOFIX installation and they
            swivel.

            If your budget doesn’t allow for an extended rear-facing car seat,
            or you have other reasons for not getting it (please don’t make this
            one of your reasons), then check out this post about non ERF car
            seat categories.
