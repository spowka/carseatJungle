                      In this Section 7, we have summarised the rights that you
                      have under data protection law. Some of the rights are
                      complex, and not all of the details have been included in
                      our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant
                      laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a
                      full explanation of these rights.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Your principal rights under data protection law are:
                      <ol type="a">
                        <li>the right to access;</li>
                        <li>the right to rectification;</li>
                        <li>the right to erasure;</li>
                        <li>the right to restrict processing;</li>
                        <li>the right to object to processing;</li>
                        <li>the right to data portability;</li>
                        <li>
                          the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
                        </li>
                        <li>the right to withdraw consent.</li>

                    <li>
                      You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we
                      process your personal data and, where we do, access to the
                      personal data, together with certain additional
                      information. That additional information includes details
                      of the purposes of the processing, the categories of
                      personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal
                      data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not
                      affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal
                      data, as described below (clause 7.13).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data
                      about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes
                      of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data
                      about you completed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of
                      your personal data without undue delay. Those
                      circumstances include: the personal data is no longer
                      necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was
                      collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to
                      consent-based processing; you object to the processing
                      under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the
                      processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the
                      personal data have been unlawfully processed. However,
                      there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general
                      exclusions include where processing is necessary: for
                      exercising the right of freedom of expression and
                      information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or
                      for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
                      claims.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the
                      processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are:
                      you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing
                      is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the
                      personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you
                      require personal data for the establishment, exercise or
                      defence of legal claims; and you have objected to
                      processing, pending the verification of that objection.
                      Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may
                      continue to store your personal data. However, we will
                      only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the
                      establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for
                      the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
                      person; or for reasons of important public interest.

                    <li>
                      You have the right to object to our processing of your
                      personal data on grounds relating to your particular
                      situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for
                      the processing is that the processing is necessary for:
                      the performance of a task carried out in the public
                      interest or in the exercise of any official authority
                      vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests
                      pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an
                      objection, we will cease to process the personal
                      information unless we can demonstrate compelling
                      legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
                      interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for
                      the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

                    <li>
                      You have the right to object to our processing of your
                      personal data for direct marketing purposes (including
                      profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such
                      an objection, we will cease to process your personal data
                      for this purpose.

                    <li>
                      You have the right to object to our processing of your
                      personal data for scientific or historical research
                      purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to
                      your particular situation, unless the processing is
                      necessary for the performance of a task carried out for
                      reasons of public interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of
                      your personal data is:
                      <ol type="a">
                        <li>consent; or</li>
                        <li>
                          that the processing is necessary for the performance
                          of a contract to which you are party or in order to
                          take steps at your request prior to entering into a
                          contract,
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                      and such processing is carried out by automated means, you
                      have the right to receive your personal data from us in a
                      structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
                      However, this right does not apply where it would
                      adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you consider that our processing of your personal
                      information infringes data protection laws, you have a
                      legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
                      authority responsible for data protection.

                      To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of
                      your personal information is consent, you have the right
                      to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not
                      affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

                      You may request that we provide you with any personal

                      information will be subject to the supply of appropriate

                      browser is closed.

                      traffic and improve our services in order to tailor them

                      modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
                      prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of
